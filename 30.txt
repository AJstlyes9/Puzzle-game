Introduction

Life’s chaos can leave us feeling overwhelmed. This 30-day plan isn’t about
drastic overhauls it’s about small, sustainable changes to improve your sleep,
nutrition, stress levels, and productivity. Let’s ditch the jargon and focus on what
works.

Chapter 1

Start Your Day Right

Morning Routines That Stick
1.

Wake Up with Purpose
- Use the Pomodoro Technique (work 25 mins, break 5 mins) to stay
focused
- Skip the snooze button. Instead, try:
- 5 minutes of stretching (e.g cat-cow poses or shoulder rolls).
- Hydrate: Drink a glass of water with lemon to kick start digestion.

2.

Plan Your Day
- Add walnuts or chia seeds to breakfast for brain health.
- Write down 1–3 priorities (e.g "Finish project draft" or "30-minute
walk").
- Use the Pomodoro Technique (work 25 mins, break 5 mins) to stay
focused.
