MAPPINGS
Definition: Given two non-empty sets A and B, if there is a rule, which assigns an element 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 a
unique element 𝑦 ∈ 𝐵, then, the rule is called MAPPING
Example
If
𝐴 = {1,2,3,4,5} And 𝐵 = {1,4,9,16,25}
It can be represented by arrow diagram as;

The above representation is called an arrow diagram of mapping
From above representation, the set A is called domain (Pre-image) of the mapping, while the set B is
called co- domain (Image) of mapping
The mapping between the sets can be represented by any of the following notation
f

B

Or
f:A
Or

B

f(x) = y ∀x ∈ A ∃ y ∈ B
Where y is the unique element in B which corresponding to the element x in A

CONDITIONS FOR MAPPING
Two important conditions that must be satisfied if a relation is to be a mapping are;
i. Every element of the domain has an image in the co-domain
ii. The image of every element of the domain is unique

Discussion of types of mappings
MODE: ENTIRE CLASS
TEACHER’S ACTIVITIES
TYPES OF MAPPINGS
ONE TO ONE MAPPING
Definition: Let 𝑓: 𝑋
𝑌 be the mapping that establishes the correspondence between the sets X
and Y. The mapping f is called a one to one mapping if different elements in the domain X have different
images in the co-domain Y. Thus, 𝑓: 𝑋
𝑌 is one to one mapping if 𝑓 (𝑥1 ) = 𝑓(𝑥2 ) implies 𝑥1 = 𝑥2
or 𝑥1 ≠ 𝑥2 implies 𝑓 (𝑥1 ) ≠ 𝑓(𝑥2 )
𝐸𝑥𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒
1. The mapping which assigh each Secondary School in F.C.T in Nigeria with its principal is on – one
mapping
2. The mapping which assign eac form masters/mistress in Gssbwari with its classes is a one – one
mapping
3. The mapping which associate each state in Nigeria with its governior is one – one mapping
4. Let X be the set of real numbers and 𝑓: 𝑋 → 𝑌 be a mapping defined by 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 + 3, then f is a one
– one mapping since every element in X has a distinct image in Y

ONTO MAPPING
Definition: Let 𝑓: 𝑋 → 𝑌 be a mapping from set X to the set Y. The mapping f is called an onto mapping if
every element of the codomain is an image of at least one element in the domain. Hence 𝑓: 𝑋 → 𝑌 is
onto mapping if range of the mapping is equal to the codomain
Example 1
Let the mapping g: 𝑋 → 𝑌 be defined by

X
a
b
c

g

Y
e
f
g

d

The range of the mapping is equal to the co-domain, hence the mapping is onto
Example 2
Let the mapping f: 𝑋 → 𝑌be defined by 𝑓(𝑥) = 2𝑥 + 3. Determine wheather mapping is onto
Solution
Let 0, ±1, ±2, ±3 ∈ 𝑋
𝑓 (0) = 3, 𝑓 (1) = 5, 𝑓 (−1) = 1, 𝑓(2) = 7, 𝑓(−2) = −1, 𝑓 (3) = 9 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑓 (−3) = −3
The range of the mapping is equal to the co- domain. Hence the mapping is one – one and onto mapping
